# 🏛️ University Project – Geekoczelnia
Geekoczelnia is a student web project developed by me and two colleagues as a prototype of a general university platform for students, lecturers, and administrative staff. The system includes features such as user login, grade assignment and review, course management, and basic communication.

The project was primarily built using Python and the Flask framework. We used bcrypt for secure password handling, stored data in JSON format, and added some JavaScript elements to enhance the interface while keeping it simple and functional.

We received the maximum number of points for the project, and our lecturer, impressed with the quality of our work, submitted it to the dean’s office as an example of a well-executed team project.
